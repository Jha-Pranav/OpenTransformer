Bob tried to move the rock, but it was too hard. He asked his friends for help, and they worked together to move it. Bob was grateful and happy to have such good friends.  One day, Bob found a magic stone that turned the rock into a beautiful butterfly, and he could move it easily. He learned that sometimes things can change, but with a little help, we can make a beautiful thing happen. Bob and his friends worked together to move the rock, and when they did, the butterfly turned into a butterfly too. It was amazing and Bob was happy to have helped the bird become a butterfly.\n",

      "  Once upon a time, there was a big beetle who lived in a garden. He liked to eat leaves and flowers, but he was always tired and needed a break. He decided to go for a walk and find a quiet place to rest.  As he walked, he saw a little girl who needed help moving something. She was carrying a big rock, but she couldn't move it. Bob decided to help and went to talk to the girl. He asked her if she needed help moving the rock, and she said yes.  Bob asked the girl to move the rock so she could take care of it. The girl was grateful and thanked Bob for his help. She moved the rock with ease, and soon they were both feeling happy and safe.  Bob felt proud of himself for helping someone in need. He decided to leave the rock in a place where it would always feel safe and happy.  The next day, he found the girl and thanked her for being a good friend. She asked him to move the rock, but he was too busy and couldn't do it. He felt sad and ashamed and wished he had helped her.  The girl was surprised and upset, but Bob apologized and promised not to do it again. She accepted his apology and helped him move the rock.  Bob was happy that she was there to help him. He learned that even when things get tough, it is okay to ask for help. And she also learned that even a lazy beetle could not help someone in need. Bob was glad to find a solution that would help her feel better in the future.  The end. \n",

      "Bob and the girl became good friends and went on many adventures together. They always helped each other and were always happy when they were together. When Bob was feeling lazy, the girl was always there to help him. They were happy to have each other and the girl was happy to have a friend like Bob.  The end. Bob was grateful for her help and promised to always be kind. The moral of the story is: always help someone in need, and if you are a good person will be there to help someone who needs you. Bob was happy to have a good friend and to be kind to his friend for helping him when needed. The end.\n",
