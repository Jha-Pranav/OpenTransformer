    "We need to define a chat template, which formats the instructions and responses in a way that is suitable for the model. Here's an example of raw instructions and responses from a Hugging Face blog post:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hi there!\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Nice to meet you!\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "There are different ways to format it. The most straightforward one would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "User: Hey there!\n",
    "Assistant: Nice to meet you!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Llama 2, the authors used the following template for the chat models:\n",
    "\n",
    "<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\n",
    "System prompt\n",
    "<</SYS>>\n",
    "User prompt [/INST] Model answer </s>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the most popular and standardized chat template is ChatML from OpenAI, which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<|im_start|>user\n",
    "Hey there!<|im_end|>\n",
    "<|im_start|>assistant\n",
    "Nice to meet you!<|im_end|>\n",
    "The impact of chat templates on the performance of the model is unclear. In most cases, we fine-tune base models that have not been trained with a particular template, which is also why there's no clear standard. However, they are important as they can cause many issues and limit the compatibility of your models."
