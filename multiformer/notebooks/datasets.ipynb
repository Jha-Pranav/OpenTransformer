It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I\\'d spend the rest of the day there just having fun with the kids.\" In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya.
